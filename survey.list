3419,4,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Suspicious,0,This run was a reinitializing beam run and had no charge feedback running. The charge asymmetry is large, and it swamps other runs in a slug. Marking as suspicious and needs cuts if anyone wants to salvage it.
3420,4,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,0,Cameron: ;* first 40k events had beam excursion, need to set a event cut on this run.;* BCMs start off noisier (120ppm instead of 80ppm...) but DD is smaller (24 ppm, instead of 45 or 60 from this morning, but not the 18 ppm from Monday...);* BPMs noise got better too, though 4eX still has larger diff width (10 um).

3455,8,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Notice that the charge asymmetry is pretty badly double peaked in this run.;;Q2 was lost the whole time for Right Arm, but Left Arm is OK;;Q2 was completely lost at ~ 103k events, so reprompting with :100k event cut place should hopefully fix regression, unless it is a charge asymmetry issue somehow (which depending of frequency could be a real problem);;The bad charge asymmetry makes we want to ditch this run entirely... question for 11 am meeting

3523,9,Parityscan,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,NoFlag,2,Cameron: Aq testing - huge % level Aq from time to time, probably not salvageable for production.
3524,9,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: the beam definitely moved during the first few thousand events - needs BPM cuts - probably will reduce the Main det noise by ~15 % hopefully;Cuts applied, and it seems to help a bit, but there still are a few events with huge offsets. Leaving in for now. If it shows up in slug plots then we'll fix.;;Update cuts: cutting out first 15k events to avoid strange BPM behavious periods
3525,9,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: large BCM width/double peaking (2x width - 250ppm);goes away next run

3532,9,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: There is a beam movement that isn't cut away in BPM 12 X and it may need special attention - Bosses say its ok
3533,9,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: Very trippy, some uncut beam movements, but otherwise regression works and its stable

3547,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good
3548,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good. Post trip, at end of run, beam changed spots.. probably ok.;;Update: cutting out end of run trip with BPM yield cut all > 1.25 4eY
3549,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good, but there is a big beam movement that appears to be slow enough to not affect the position differences;;Update: Out of fear of hitting copper we are cutting everything > 0.5 mm away from nomical. That means first 160k events are killed now -> new bad cuts applied
3550,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good
3551,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: good, has a long trip + beam excursion, but its fine (according to the bosses)
3552,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good to me
3553,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: only a few thousand Muls survive....
3554,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: Looks good to me (a bit unstable beam, but ok after cuts)
3555,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: First run in "always on" FFB mode;BCM widths are even wider now (180 ppm instead of 130 as earlier in morning);FFB on means the BPMs have more noise. Noisier in Y especially, but Regression works, and the FFB system locks the positions nicely.
3556,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: FFB on phase, looks good
3557,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: The BPMs look noisier as FFB is on now, but now the Current has a double peaking (250 ppm width or so, and 0.4 ppm mean). Looks ok
3558,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: broad BCM noise again, 280 ppm widths Aq, looks good
3559,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good, but BCM is still wide (not double peaked now...)
3560,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: wide BCM widths still, 0.4 ppm Aq, and there is a BCM spike not killed by stability cut...
3561,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good
3562,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good
3563,10,Production,IN,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: Everything looks pretty good
3564,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Bad,2,Cameron: main det HV off the whole run, all gets cut
3565,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Bad,2,Cameron: main det hv off the whole run, all gets cut
3566,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good, but wider BCM Aq and Main Dets than normal
3567,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks better. The BCM and detector widths went down nicely. We are investigating whether the injector has clipping issues or something like that.
3568,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: the BPM 4aY is broader than I remember, but it had a bit of movement and FFB is now on always.. so its ok. Main det regressed widths and BCM noise look better too
3569,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: Everything looks normal to me for FFB on status
3570,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good to me
3571,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: There is a regression defying tail in the main detectors. The only thing I see that looks bad is the BPM 12X FFB off times where the signal jumps by 50 um - it looks like there is bimodal fitting on BPM 4eX - needs cuts;;Its actually due to blinder failing! ;Devi: Glitch is fixed, though the blinder is still 0'd out.
3572,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks good
3573,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: needs cut - has 1.4 ppm Aq mean due to 33k mul to 42k mul Aq feedback failure.;Devi: applied cut CodaEventNumber>132000&&CodaEventNumber<172000 .... Aq is now ~0.2ppm
3574,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: clearly has energy slippage during beam mod. This is now a feature of FFB on/off running mode. Looks good
3575,11,Production,OUT,FLIP-RIGHT,Good,2,Cameron: looks fine

4440,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks fine, but BCM has some clipping symptoms that aren't being cut out (probably OK);;machine reproducibility problems gives larger BPM widths, increase burp cut from 0.2mm to 0.35 mm to recover data

4467,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks ok, had some Compton beam tuning and one thing in 4eX gets event cuts applied;;Looks Good
4468,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks ok... does current ramp rate or beam trip holdoff need to lengthen?
4469,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks ok, but the beam got really zig-zagging and went pretty far at 4aY, needs cuts?
4470,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks ok, but more beam tuning and large Y jumps
4471,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: regression is OK, but the BCM and bpms are both having noisy motion
4472,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: more beam motion, regression is fine. Applying tighter (0.2mm) burp cut to BPMs for this run as a test case and to see how the smaller burp cut changes things -> has no noticeable effect (need stability cut?)
4473,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: awful trips, but cuts work, regression is OK
4474,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks fine, BPM motion still
4475,60,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks good, but some noise in BPMs on a few events

4477,61,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Suspicious,0,Cameron: beam looks better, looks OK;;Aq was off, needs cuts but relabeled as suspicious
4478,61,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Suspicious,0,Cameron & Ryan: looks ok, but some beam trips have restoration motion after them still;;Aq was off, needs cuts later - relabeled as suspicious

4480,61,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks ok
4481,61,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: X axis has excessive diff noise. Needs cuts? Regression looks OK.;;Ryan: Yes, needs position cut - 1 mm drift - tighter burp cuts not sufficient;;Cameron: adding 0.35 stability cut as well as a test;;Can't quite clear it out, but the BPM post-trip drift is not totally bad, and the diffs hairyness is going to stick around
4482,61,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: diff noise in X is still here, but fades away. Probably OK, doesn't affect regression;;Ryan: needs cut on positions - tighter burp cuts - works;;Cameron: adding 0.35 stability cut to these two runs as well as a test - also works

4492,62,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: non trivial beam motion, but < 0.5 mm, looks OK
4493,62,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: 4eX centers around the middle of the target, so no cut needed there, but 4aY needs some cut at the beginning - cut out first 5k events;;Looks OK

4511,63,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: complement 4e BPM trips out some. An US BCM trips out some. Main det widths have been larger in the last few runs, and regression suffers (can only reach 98 ppm instead of 95)
4512,63,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: Gang Phase changed half way through run in order to preserve compton rates. Makes left HRS widths and BPM widths much worse (10 um -> 15um);;Complement 4e BPM sees weird glitches still;;Reprompt with 0.35 burp and stability cut to see if beam trip issue around event 200000 can be resolved - it mostly works, but needs some work later
4513,63,Production,OUT,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: looks OK. Wider post-gang-phase-change Main Det widths and BPM diff widths, but not a huge deal;;LHRS main det unregressed width ~ 1000 ppm and ~2x RHRS widths
4514,64,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Cameron: trying simple stability and burp 0.35 cut to see if it fixes the 4eY trip recovery glitches we've seen with no other cut necessary.;-> doesn't... use bad event cuts. Looks OK

4722,76,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,AJZ: Starting with this run we see large fluctuations in 4aY and 4eY. Very seldom does it;require cutting, but it's worth monitoring.

4908,91,Production,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Good,0,Devi: last minirun has 50uA current, which has caused the widths to blow up. MCC was working on Compton stuffs, there are ~0.5mm level of BPM excurstion.;weibin: apply bad event cut: prex_bad_events.4908.map; change run flag from NeedCut to Good
4909,91,Junk,IN,FLIP-LEFT,Bad,0,weibin: run taken during compton tuning, mark it as suspecious and then drop it in grand plots
